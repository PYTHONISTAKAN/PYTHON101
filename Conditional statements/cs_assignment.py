"""Problem 1
Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the height and weight values entered by the user, and display the following messages according to the rules:
BMI Formula: Weight / Height(m) * Height(m)
If BMI is below 18.5 -------> Underweight
If BMI is between 18.5 and 25 -------> Normal
If BMI is between 25 and 30 -------> Overweight
If BMI is above 30 -------> Obese
Problem 2
Get three numbers from the user and display the largest number.
Problem 3
Calculate the letter grade based on the midterm 1, midterm 2, and final exam grades entered by the user.
Midterm 1 will affect 30% of the total grade.
Midterm 2 will affect 30% of the total grade.
Final will affect 40% of the total grade.
Total Grade >= 90 -------> AA
Total Grade >= 85 -------> BA
Total Grade >= 80 -------> BB
Total Grade >= 75 -------> CB
Total Grade >= 70 -------> CC
Total Grade >= 65 -------> DC
Total Grade >= 60 -------> DD
Total Grade >= 55 -------> FD
Total Grade < 55 -------> FF
Problem 4
Now, letâ€™s do a geometric shape calculation. First, ask the user whether they want to calculate the properties of a triangle or a quadrilateral.
If the user answers "Quadrilateral", ask for 4 sides and determine whether this quadrilateral is a square, rectangle, or an irregular quadrilateral.
If the user answers "Triangle", ask for 3 sides and determine whether this triangle is isosceles, equilateral, or an irregular triangle. If the given sides do not form a valid triangle, display the message "Not a triangle."""
